# `radui`

RadUI is a meta design system used to create UI design systems (with support for only React.js at the moment). Using RadUI, developers should be able to:

- import `@radui/core` with a few lines and easily build UIs with component library
- completely customize every aspect of the theming, including drastic changes with a few modifications
- override any part of a component with ease

## TODO

- [ ] fix build system so that javascript & typescript apps can easily import project
- [ ] add other components
- [ ] enable purgecss to eliminate unused css
- [ ] add examples
- [ ] UI/wizard for generating or customizing the themes on the fly
